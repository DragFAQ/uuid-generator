# uuid-generator

## Description
Develop an stateful application containing generated uuid hash in its memory.

Hash should be recreated every 5 minutes.

Application should contain two api servers: gRPC and http.

Each api should implement single endpoint to get actual hash string and hash generation datetime.

Cover code with unit tests where itâ€™s needed.

This app should demonstrate coding quality, app design skills, golang best practices, etc.

It is preferable to upload the results of the work to github or some other public repo.

## Notes

Generally, this app could be contained in just one small main.go file, especially if we're certain it won't expand. However, if it becomes part of a microservice architecture, we may want to move some packages into shared libraries and reuse it in another apps.

## How to run

In project root create your own .env file (based on [env.example](env.example))

To make clean production build and run it locally:
```shell
docker-compose up --build uuid-generator
```
To make and run build for debugging:
```shell
docker-compose up --build uuid-generator-debug
```
After running, you can connect to localhost:40000 to debug it

To run tests:
```shell
go test -v -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
```

## Use
For HTTP endpoint call http://localhost:8080

For GRPC call grpc://localhost:8090 rpc GetCurrentHash
